          <p id="tribute-info" > He is my cool dad that I love very much. He was born in 1975. He is a hardworker who helps feed the family. I want to have the persistence he has when I'm old like him. He always attempts to reach ambitious goals layed down by himself. He owns a chicken farm and sometimes he'll pick up a chicken or rabiit and ask it funny questions. He is a great father.
